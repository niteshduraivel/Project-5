          <p>A notable chapter in my commitment to community service unfolded during my involvement with Ashwini Eye Care Hospital in Chennai, India, in July 2017. During this period, I actively supported the hospital's Free Vision Screening program, which specifically catered to economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>
          <p>My responsibilities encompassed assisting elderly patients by guiding them within the hospital premises, offering aid in the application of eye drops, and facilitating the completion of registries. These hands-on experiences provided me with a profound understanding of the challenges faced by the economically backward population and underscored the importance of accessible healthcare.</p>
          <p>Being part of Ashwini Eye Care Hospital's initiative was not just a service opportunity; it was a chance to contribute to a cause that goes beyond immediate impact. It deepened my appreciation for the power of community service in addressing essential healthcare needs and instilled in me a sense of responsibility to continue making a positive difference in the lives of others.</p>
