            <p>Hello there! I'm Nitesh Duraivel, a 21-year-old student studying Computer Science at Texas A&M College Station. Originally from Abu Dhabi, UAE, I came to the United States for my studies.</p>
            <p>I began my educational journey in Abu Dhabi, which provided a strong foundation for my passion for technology. My major is Computer Science, and it has not only given me a solid education but also deepened my interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>I enjoy watching TV shows and playing video games in my spare time. I enjoy the virtual worlds of games like Valorant and League of Legends, where cooperation and strategic thinking are valued highly. These encounters excite me while simultaneously developing my problem-solving abilities and fostering close relationships.</p>
            <p>I've also become really interested in watching TV series and anime during the past two years. My leisure activities now have more depth because to this new interest, which has revealed fascinating new worlds of storytelling and creativity.</p>
            <p>One remarkable aspect of my life is the series of incidents that led to a even total of 30 stitches. The first was when I was just 2 years old and had a little accident, needing 18 stitches. Later, there was another incident when I fell down a school gallery, requiring 8 stitches. And in yet another twist, a metal door at school swung back unexpectedly and struck the back of my head, needing 4 stitches. These experiences have taught me the value of resilience and determination.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, I have a twin sister who is pursuing Fashion Technology in Chennai, India, and aspires to pursue her masters in London. Despite being twins, we have very different interests, which is quite fascinating.</p>
            <p>I'm keen to delve further into the fascinating field of artificial intelligence as I complete my studies. I'm committed to advancing AI research and development using the knowledge I get from my computer science curriculum, bringing fresh perspectives that will influence our upcoming technologies.</p>
